This repository contains the work and methodologies for the verification and validation of the AHB2APB bridge design. Our objective has been to employ both SystemVerilog and UVM-based test bench development methodologies to create Verification IP (VIP) components, ensuring a comprehensive and robust verification strategy for the AHB-APB Bridge design.
